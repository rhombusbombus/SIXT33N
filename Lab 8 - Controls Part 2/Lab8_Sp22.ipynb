    "In the previous lab, we developed a closed-loop controller to make the car go straight. However, we also want the car to be able to turn left and right! In this lab, we will modify the control scheme from Lab 7 to enable the car to turn. For a refresher on our closed-loop controller, please refer to the Controls Part 1 lab note [here](https://www.eecs16b.org/labs/notes/handson_note7_controls1_sp22.pdf). There is no lab note for Lab 8 and everything you need is in this notebook!"

    "### We have been turning during Closed-Loop Control!\n",
    "We can get a clue about turning by considering how we implemented closed-loop control. We perform feedback control of S1XT33N in order to minimize the difference between the two wheels ($\\delta[i] = d_L[i] - d_R[i]$). When perturbations cause one wheel to get ahead of the other resulting in non-zero $\\delta$, feedback control turns the car to correct the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through this.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our feedback control policy is: \n",
    "$$u_L[i] = u_L^{OL} - \\frac{f_L}{\\theta_L}\\delta[i]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$u_R[i] = u_R^{OL} + \\frac{f_R}{\\theta_R}\\delta[i]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say the right wheel has moved further than the left ($d_R[i] > d_L[i]$), resulting in a negative $\\delta[i]$. A negative $\\delta[i]$ results in a reduction of $u_R[i]$, and an increase of $u_L[i]$. But what does this mean physically?\n",
    "\n",
    "If the right wheel is getting ahead of the left one, the left wheel will need to move a little faster and the right wheel a little slower for the wheels to even back out. Thus, feedback control corrects errors by turning to compensate for them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "So $\\delta \\ne 0$ can be used to turn the car. Let's get more specific.  \n"

    "\n",
    "To turn, we need to manually add some $\\delta_{ref}$ to our $\\delta$ value in every time step during the turn. By doing so, we are tricking our control scheme into thinking that our car has turned by some amount and generated that extra $\\delta_{ref}$ of error, and cause it to turn in the other direction to compensate. Without loss of generality, we'll analyze a right turn, corresponding to adding a **negative** $\\delta_{ref}$ value (we trick the car into thinking it has turned left, so it turns right as \"compensation\"). For a left turn, we simply add in a **positive** $\\delta_{ref}$ instead. Our goal is to generate this $\\delta_{ref}$ from the desired $r$ and $v^*$ for the controller to follow. It will be a function of the controller's time-step, as we want our car to turn gradually, rather than pivot turn.\n",

    " \n",
    "In our implementation, the control loop and the data collection have different periods because we want the controller to update the trajectory every tenth of a second instead of every half a second, which was our data collection rate. Because of this, we run into an issue when we're trying to implement turning at the same speed by adding in some $\\delta_{ref}$ in each time step, as the definition of the time step is dependent on the sampling period we use. To fix this, we need to change our v* when we use it while implementing turning, or else the car will not move at the correct velocity while it turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the sampling periods of the control loop and the data collection be $T_c$ and $T_d$, respectively, and their sampling frequencies $F_c$ and $F_d$, respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "$F_c$, with units [$\\frac{sample_c}{s}$], is the number of times the closed-loop is sampled every second, and $F_d$, with units [$\\frac{sample_d}{s}$], is the number of times data collection was sampled per second. Let $v^*_c$ be the velocity of closed-loop, and $v^*$ be the velocity of the data collection. $v^*_c$ has the units of [$\\frac{ticks}{sample_c}$] and $v^*$ has units [$\\frac{ticks}{sample_d}$].\n",

    "To get a constant $\\frac{ticks}{s}$, we need $v^*_c * F_c = v^* * F_d$.\n",

If our v* was collected to be 100 ticks/sample, that means every .5 seconds, we expect our car to move 100 ticks (assuming constant velocity). Now, in our controller, our sampling rate is now .1 seconds. If we use the same v* of 100 ticks/sample, we are now saying that we expect our car to move 100 ticks in .1 seconds, because the controller does not have the information that the original sampling period during data collection was .5 seconds. That means the velocity has effectively quintupled! To account for this, we will divide v* by 5 when using a v* value for turning.\n",
