It's a useful tool for prototyping circuits before building them physically, allowing you to plan and test the placement of parts and wires. Tinkercad uses some elements and components that may be different from the parts we use in the hands-on kit, which we'll point out to you, but be mindful of this when comparing Tinkercad circuits and our physical circuits.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The top and bottom + power rails$*$ will be 5V, while the - rails will be GND.\n",
    "- Block A35-J38 and A15-J18 will be reserved for the chip op-amp 1 and op-amp 2, respectively. We will explain the pinout and wire routing later. Chips like the op-amp MUST straddle the \"notch\" (the trench stretching the length of the breadboard). This is so you don't accidentally short the legs on opposite sides of the chip together.\n",
    "- Column 37F-37J is the pin where the signal from the microcontroller (Pin 13) will be connected to.\n",
    "\n",
    "$*$__The decoupling capacitor placed between power rails and ground is used to remove AC noise from the supply and help stablize the voltage of the power rails relative to ground (more on this in future labs later on in the course).__\n",

    "$*$__The top and bottom rows are linked horizontally all the way across. The other holes are linked vertically in blocks of 5 with no link across the centre.__\n",
    "\n",
    "### Circuit Guidelines\n",
    "#### General Circuit Rules\n",
    "- Make sure you use consistent colors for ground, power voltages, etc. __Black is usually reserved for GND, and red for power__.\n",
    "- Try not to have any excessively long wires; shorten them so that it's easier to follow and debug later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tinkercad Tips\n",
    "- Pay attention to how the two supply multimeters are connected, and connect the third unconnected meter appropriately to measure the signal of interest.\n",
    "- For easier readability of your layout, when creating wires, it is possible to add bends by \"clicking their path\". Try to avoid crossing wires as much as you can for better visualization, and use different colors for different signals if possible.\n",
    "- DO NOT connect multiple wires or component legs to the same hole. Tinkercad lets you do this, but this is physically impossible to do on a real breadboard, so do not do this.\n",
    "- Make sure your components (like resistors) go into holes on the breadboard, and DO NOT have any legs dangling in empty space. Tinkercad will let you connect floating components, but you can't physically do this with real hardware, so don't do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Circuit Power Rails\n",
    "- The + and - rails are reserved for power and GND, respectively. Avoid connecting any other signals to those rails.\n",
    "- Make sure all voltage supplies have the same reference voltage. They should all have their negative terminals connected to the negative power rail (-), which is GND.\n",
    "- ALWAYS connect at least one of the GND pins on microcontrollers (e.g. Arduinos and Launchpads) to the GND rail.\n",
    "- The + and - long rails on the sides of the breadboards are not connected to their corresponding rail on the other side. Make sure to ALWAYS connect your - rails so that both sides of the breadboard have easy access to GND. Only connect your + rails when you want them to carry the same voltage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### LEDs are polarized!\n",
    "- Note that LEDs have polarity, meaning the direction you plug it into the circuit matters.\n",
    "- __The anode (+) is the longer/crooked leg of the LED, while the cathode (-) is the shorter/straight leg of the LED__.\n",
    "- If you reverse the direction of the LED, the current will not be able to flow and the LED will not light up.\n",
