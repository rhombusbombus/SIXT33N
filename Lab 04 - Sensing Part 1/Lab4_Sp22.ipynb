However, you might have noticed that the range of motion is quite limited when we are using the lab station's DC power supply to power our circuits. We need a portable way to power your circuits so that S1XT33N can freely roam on the ground. Also, our end goal is to have S1XT33N be voice-controlled, and in order to do that, we need a way for S1XT33N to listen to what you're saying.\n"

    "Before we build the mic board circuitry, we will first build the regulator circuits to enable portable powering of our circuits. You may have noticed that the only batteries we give you in the kits are 9V batteries, but we need access to both 3.3V and 5V for our circuits to work properly. In most electrical systems, you only have access to one or two main supply voltages (such as 9V from a 9V battery) that often times are not what you need for your circuits. In order to generate specific voltages, you need to build a voltage regulator to \"regulate\" the supply voltage to what you require. The inner workings of these regulators is beyond the scope of the class, so we will not discuss them in detail, nor build our own. In our kits, we have provided you 2 regulator components that will work so long as you build the necessary circuits around them: the 5V regulator and 3.3V regulator. These components will take the 9V from one of your batteries and generate 5V and 3.3V, respectively.\n",

If you see flat edges/lines on either the top or bottom of the waveform instead of the smooth peaks and troughs of the sine wave, which happens if you have Vpp $\\geq$3.3V, your mic board is railing, and you need to reduce the amplitude of the mic board output. Note that because we set the mic board VDD to 5V, the bottom of the sine wave will rail first, as the sine wave is centered at 1.65V, not the midpoint of the op-amp range of 0-5V.\n",

    "- **DO NOT use autoscale on the oscilloscope!** It will not work well with our mic board signal because the signal varies very rapidly. Using autoscale often sets the timescale to a few nanoseconds, which is too small of a timescale to see anything of importance or value for us.\n",

Finding the frequency response is the best way to know how your system will react to a range of frequencies. Usually this is performed with a linear sweep of every value within the range of frequencies that your system will be tasked with handling, but as this is not feasible for this lab, you will just be testing and measuring values for a finite list of frequencies spread out across the entire range. \n",

Here we will measure how this cascaded system reacts to certain discrete pure tone frequency inputs to get a general idea of how our speaker-microphone system will react to other frequencies within our range.\n",
