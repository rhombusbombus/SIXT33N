    "In the previous lab, you learned how microcontrollers like Arduinos and Launchpads interact with the world via DACs and ADCs. With that knowledge, we can now begin working on our project, which will use the Launchpad as its \"brain\" or core. For the rest of this semester you will be designing S1XT33N, a mischievous little robot who might just do what you want - if you design it correctly. Our end goal is to have S1XT33N listen to your voice commands and execute the corresponding drive command. In this lab, you will build S1XT33N’s legs: you will build the motor control circuits that enable S1XT33N to move around and the encoder circuits that enable your Launchpad\n",

    "This lab's motor controller and encoder circuits correspond to the light blue sections on the project breadboard layout below. **We strongly recommend that you follow this layout as you build the different circuits for S1XT33N.** The motor/encoder circuits also require the 3.3V rail, which provides 3.3V to many of the front-end circuits for this car, and the `Motor 9V Rail`, which provides 9V to the motors. In this lab, both rails will be powered by the power supply. In future labs, the 3.3V rail will be powered by the 3.3V voltage regulator while the `Motor 9V Rail` will be powered by the 9V battery. **For all parts of the project, make sure to connect the two negative rails for GND and the two positive rails for the 3.3V rail** so that both sides of the breadboard can easily access the same ground and 3.3V.\n",

    "1.  **Construct the circuit below for each wheel using the <a href=\"https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/308/1/KSC2690A_D-2314385.pdf\">C2690A</a> NPN BJT on the project breadboard**. You will be building this circuit twice, once for the left motor, and once for the right motor. **We strongly recommend you build these circuits in the light blue sections on the project breadboard layout above.** See below for the pinouts and diagrams of the different components. <img width=\"250px\" src=\"images/motor-drive-with-switch.jpg\">\n",
    "    - The pin diagram of the BJT is reproduced below. <span style=\"color:#ba190f\">**Make sure to match the Base, Emitter, and Collector properly to the schematic. Note the diagram shows 3 circles facing up.**</span>\n",
    "    <img width=\"250px\" src=\"images/proj-bjt.png\">\n",
    "    - A <a href=\"https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/textbook/semiconductors/chpt-3/introduction-to-diodes-and-rectifiers/\">diode</a> is a component that only conducts current one way. This diode is needed because of the inductive characteristics of the motor. If the motor is on and we turn it off, the inductive behavior of the motor generates a back emf that maintains the current and we need a way to dissipate it when the switch is off. The diode provides the pathway to do so. The diagram for the diode is shown below. **Note that the diode has a direction** - be careful which terminal is attached to the 9V power supply. \n",
    "<img width=\"300px\" src=\"images/proj-diode.png\">\n",

    "#### Uploading Energia code review:\n",
    "1. Download **`motor_test.ino`** and open it up in Energia. Connect your Launchpad to the back USB port of the computer tower using the micro-USB cable.\n",
    "2. Hit the window key and open up \"Device Manager\" on your computer. Under the ports tab, you should see a device called MSP Application UART. Note the COM port number (```COM###```).\n",
    "3. In Energia, under Tools -> Port, make sure to select the COM port you have just identified.\n",
    "4. In Energia, under Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager, make sure Energia MSP430 boards has version 1.0.7 installed.\n",
    "5. Press the upload button (the right pointing arrow, **not** the checkmark) and make sure the terminal says \"success\".\n",
    "6. Press the RST button on the Launchpad whenever you want to rerun the program.\n",
    "7. If you open up the serial monitor (Tools -> Serial Monitor), make sure to set the specified baud rate in the code. You'll see the baud rate under something like ```Serial.begin(38400)```, where 38400 is the baud rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tasks:\n",
    "Here, we will be testing each motor circuit **one at a time**.\n",
    "1. Connect the node labeled **<span style=\"color:#ba190f\">MSP430 Pin 2.0</span>** in one of the motor controller circuits to **<span style=\"color:#ba190f\">P2.0</span>** on your Launchpad. **Make sure to ground your Launchpad** (connect any Launchpad GND pin to the negative rail of breadboard)! There should be **no** other connections between your project breadboard and the Launchpad aside from `P2.0` and GND. Turn on the power supply output.\n",
    "      - If `P2.0` is no longer functional, any free pins of `P1.4`, `P1.5`, `P2.4`, or `P2.5` will also work. If you're using one of these other pins, you'll have to update the pin definition in the `motor_test.ino` code to reflect that.\n",
    "2. Upload `motor_test.ino` to your Launchpad and hit `RST`.\n",
    "3. Open the Serial Monitor (`CTRL-SHIFT-L` / `CMD-SHIFT-L`). Set the baud rate to **38400**.\n",
    "    As the program runs, you should see the \"Duty Cycle\" reading change in the Serial Monitor. Your motor should speed up as the duty cycle increases, and slow down as it decreases. \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:#ba190f\">**4. Repeat for the *other motor circuit*. Make sure that both motors drive as expected. They might not go at the same speed - our control scheme will fix that later in the project.**</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Debugging Tips:\n",
    "- The motor is reversible so connect it in any direction for now. If it turns out to go backwards later, just exchange the two wires of the motor.\n",
    "- If one motor is working but the other isn’t, try plugging the nonfunctional one into the functional motor’s motor circuit to isolate if the issue is the motor circuit or the motor. \n",
    "- If you think the motor is the issue, you can try putting 9V across the motor seperate from the motor circuit to see if it moves.\n",
    "- If your motor is not moving, we want to isolate the problem. You can try the following steps. \n",
    "    1. Make sure the switch is on and that the power supply is on. Probe the cathode terminal of the diode— if the switch is on, this should always be at 9V.\n",
    "    2. Ensure the diode and BJT are plugged in facing the right direction.\n",
    "    3. Probing where `P2.0` is plugged in with the oscilloscope will allow you to check whether there is a PWM signal varying between 0V and 3.3V reaching the breadboard. The signal should vary based on the duty cycle printed on the Seial Monitor. If there is no PWM signal, your jumper cable or Launchpad pin might be at fault. If you encounter multiple faulty jumper cables, call your TA over.\n",
    "    4. Probe the anode terminal of the diode. When the motors are not moving, this should be at 9V (providing 0V across the motor). As the duty cycle changes, you should see this voltage change, causing the motors to move. If this is not the case, your BJT circuit or diode may be broken."

Additionally, the signal from the encoder `S` pin should alternate between 0V when the light is on and 3.3V when the light is off. If the light stays off or there is no output from the `S` pin, ensure that the encoder pin `V` is receiving 3.3V and `G` is plugged into GND by probing your rails. Ensure your encoder wheels are on. If this doesn't work or the lights only stay on, it could be that your encoder is broken or your jumper wires are faulty.\n",
    "    2. Ensure that the signal from the `S` pin is being divided to a voltage between $2.0V$ and $2.5V$ by the voltage divider you created. Probe the output of the voltage divider to verify this. It should be at 0V when the encoder light is on and between $2.0V$ and $2.5V$ when the encoder light is off. \n",
